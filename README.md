## AI Archetypes
We have 3 agents: Visitors, Police man and Mechanics.

### Visitors

Visitors will spend their money in your Stadium. Make sure you gain money with the tickets and that the stadium gets full!

### Police

They will patrol and make sure visitors pay the entrance ticket. If someone does not pay they will take him out.

### Mechanics

Mechanics will be investigating during the nightime in order to create faster bikes/monster trucks so the show increases.
Faster bikes = More money!
