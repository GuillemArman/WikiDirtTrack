# DirtTrack
We are two stuents from CITM UPC developing an Artificial Intelligence videogame for the AI subject.

Dirt Track
Dirt Track is a Stadium Manager. Everyday day people will come to your stadium, manage the ticket price and upgrade the races thanks to the mechanics. During night cops will patrol. 

Use WASD or the mouse in order to move the camera. You can do zoom with the wheel (ONLY IN CAMERA 4).
After 3 days the game ends.

### Police

They will patrol at night. During day they will look out the visitors. If some visitor tries to sneak and don't pay the ticket, cops will chase them and make them pay a fee.

### Mechanics

Mechanics will be taking care of the race. If vehicles runn out of fuel they will refill it. Buy more mechanics in order to make the race more chaotic and fun! 
More vehicles = More money!
